% This is an implementation of the algorithm for calculating the
% Feature SIMilarity (FSIM) index between two images.
%
% Please refer to the following paper
%
% Lin Zhang, Lei Zhang, Xuanqin Mou, and David Zhang,"FSIM: a feature similarity
% index for image qualtiy assessment", submitted to IEEE Transactions on Image
% Processing.
% 
%----------------------------------------------------------------------
%
%Input : (1) imageRef: the first image being compared
%        (2) imageDis: the second image being compared
%
%Output: (1) FSIM: is the similarty score calculated using FSIM algorithm. FSIM
%	     only considers the luminance component of images. For colorful images, 
%            they will be converted to the grayscale at first.
%        (2) FSIMc: is the similarity score calculated using FSIMc algorithm. FSIMc
%            considers both the grayscale and the color information.
%Note: For grayscale images, the returned FSIM and FSIMc are the same.
%        
%-----------------------------------------------------------------------
%
%Usage:
%Given 2 test images img1 and img2. For gray-scale images, their dynamic range should be 0-255.
%For colorful images, the dynamic range of each color channel should be 0-255.

% Construct the radial filter components...

% incorporated as this seems to upset the normalisation process when

  % For each point in the filter matrix calculate the angular distance from

  % and then the atan2 function is used to determine angular distance.
