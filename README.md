# Image-Quality-Assessment

## FID

Pytorch and Python3 version of

- FID（Fréchet inception distance）[1]: smaller is better.
- SIFID（Single Image Fréchet Inception Distance）[2]: smaller is better.
- C-FID（Clean FID）[3]: smaller is better.
- LPIPS（Learned Perceptual Image Patch Similarity）[4]: smaller is better.

## IQA

Matlab version of

- SCOOT（Structure Co-Occurrence Texture）[5]: bigger is better.
- PSNR（Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio）: bigger is better.
- SSIM（Structural Similarity Index Measure）[6]: bigger is better.
- FSIM（Feature Similarity Index Measure）[7]: bigger is better.
- MAE（Mean Absolute Error）: bigger is better.

## NLDA

Matlab version of

- NLDA（Null-space Linear Discriminant Analysis）[8]
